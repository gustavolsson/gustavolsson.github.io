    <p>When I moved to the new site, I decided not to have a blog because I wanted to focus on making things instead writing updates. What I&rsquo;ve realized is that there is a point to summarizing and publishing a log entry of what I work on from time to time. It helps me see the progress that I&rsquo;m making more clearly and it also gives me time to think through the decisions I make along the way. So here it is!</p>
<p>This log will primarily be written for myself as a reference for the future and as a means to be more productive. However, I will also post more official news items regarding my commercial projects from time to time.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been focused on physical projects so the log will start off with these and then as I get more free time from university I&rsquo;ll start working on the go toolkits again. I have a long list of improvements I want to make to each of the toolkits, so stay tuned :)</p>
